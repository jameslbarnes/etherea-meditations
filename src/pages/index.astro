            A kaleidoscopic burst of rainbow colors explodes across a dreamy landscape,

            <p>Find a comfortable position and take a deep breath in... and out...</p>
            
            <p>Imagine yourself standing before this magnificent landscape of infinite colors. 
              Each breath draws you deeper into this sacred space where rainbows dance and 
              light flows like water.</p>

            <p>As you breathe in, envision yourself absorbing the vibrant energies before you - 
              the deep purples of wisdom, the blues of tranquility, the greens of growth, 
              the yellows of joy, the oranges of creativity, and the reds of vitality.</p>

            <p>With each exhale, feel yourself becoming more present, more aware, more alive. 
              Watch how the colors swirl and blend, teaching us that life isn't rigid or 
              fixed - it's fluid, ever-changing, full of unexpected beauty.</p>

            <p>Like these ethereal waterfalls, sometimes we need to let ourselves flow, to 
              surrender to the present moment rather than trying to control it.</p>

            <p>Notice how each color has its place in this symphony of light. Just as this 
              landscape holds space for every shade and hue, allow yourself to embrace all 
              of life's experiences - the bright moments that dazzle us, the subtle tones 
              that whisper wisdom, and even the darker shades that help us grow.</p>

            <p>As you continue breathing deeply, set your intention to approach this year 
              with the same openness that you're feeling now. Like these swirling lights 
              and colors, life is constantly offering us moments of magic and beauty. 
              They're always there - our task is simply to be present enough to witness them.</p>

            <p>Take one final deep breath, filling yourself with this rainbow of possibilities. 
              Carry this image in your heart as a reminder to pause, to notice, to absorb 
              the beauty that surrounds you every day.</p>

            <p>When you're ready, slowly open your eyes, knowing that this sense of wonder 
              and presence is always available to you, waiting to be discovered in each new moment.</p>
