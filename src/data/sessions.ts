    intention: "I intend to challenge myself to be witnessed and go first. In 2025, I will build stages for hundreds of people and facilitate groups for hundreds of people. I will own my power, stop playing small, and do things that scare me even when I don't feel ready.",

      "Step forward. Even before you feel ready. Especially before you feel ready. Feel your power rising not from the absence of fear, but from your willingness to move with it, to let it fuel you rather than stop you.",
      "The stage is yours. The time is yours. Your voice carries the weight of wisdom and the lightness of truth. You are not playing small anymore - you are expanding into the fullness of who you've always been."

    intention: "My intention centers on three words: Love, empowerment, and growth. Love - with an open heart chakra guiding all decisions.

      "Now enter the doorway of power. See those old patterns where your light dimmed for others. Watch them dissolve like morning mist. Your power doesn't diminish others - it inspires them. Reclaim it, breath by breath.",
      "Finally, walk through the doorway of growth. Every mistake, every misstep, every moment of learning glows like a star in your path. These aren't failures - they're the very steps that make your journey unique. Honor them."
